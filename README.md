# ROS2 Virtual Robot Workspace

A development workspace for a ROS2-based virtual robot.  
Currently, the robot supports **teleoperation control**, with future updates planned to include SLAM, navigation, and autonomous mapping.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This workspace (`virtual_bot_ws`) is being developed to simulate an autonomous robot using ROS2 and Gazebo.  
It provides a foundation for testing robot models, control systems, and mapping algorithms in a simulated environment.

**Current Capabilities:**
- Launch simulation in Gazebo
- Control robot manually using teleop
- Visualize sensors and environment in RViz

**Under Development:**
- SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
- Path planning & obstacle avoidance
- Sensor simulation (LIDAR, Camera)
- Full autonomous navigation

## ⚙️ Requirements

- **ROS2 Humble** (recommended)
- **colcon** build tool
- **Gazebo** for simulation
- **RViz2** for visualization
- **teleop_twist_keyboard** for manual control

Install teleop if missing:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-teleop-twist-keyboard
````

---

## 🚀 Build Instructions

Clone this repository and build the workspace:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mahmudul626/my_ros2_robot.git ~/virtual_bot_ws
cd ~/virtual_bot_ws

# Build the workspace
colcon build

# Source the setup file
source install/setup.bash
```

---

## ▶️ Run the Simulation

Launch the virtual robot in Gazebo:

```bash
ros2 launch autonomous_bot simulation.launch.py
```

Then, control it via teleop:

```bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
```

(Optional) Visualize the simulation in RViz:

```bash
ros2 launch autonomous_bot mapping.launch.py
```

## 🧩 Future Development

Planned improvements and research directions:

* Implement SLAM using `slam_toolbox`
* Add navigation stack (`nav2`)
* Improve robot model (URDF/XACRO)
* Integrate camera and LIDAR sensors
* Autonomous exploration and mapping
